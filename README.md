**About Me**
🎓 I am a recent graduate of GCOEARA, where I honed my analytical and problem-solving skills.

💡 Curiosity is my driving force. I am always eager to explore new technologies, methodologies, and tools in the field of software testing.
I firmly believe in the importance of ensuring that every piece of code is not just functional, but also robust and reliable.

🧪 I have a solid foundation in manual testing, having mastered various testing techniques such as functional, regression, and user acceptance testing. 
I am enthusiastic about applying this knowledge to ensure the seamless operation of software applications.

🤖 Automation excites me! I have started my journey into test automation using popular tools like Selenium and JUnit.
My goal is to create efficient and effective automated test scripts that enhance the testing process and help catch bugs early in the development cycle.

📊 Attention to detail is my forte. I thrive on meticulously identifying and documenting defects, collaborating closely with developers to reproduce issues, 
and ensuring that every bug is thoroughly tracked until it's squashed.
